# TechLinkProjectAPIv1

Over the last one year, I had an habit of saving the links which I came across as part of my learning/reading in to my mailbox. Now I thought of creating a page which will have easy access for the same. As part of the first step in this project, I had created this API for my angular app which is in progress.

//High level Arch : app.js calls router.js and db connections, router.js then calls the controllers, controllers then calls the models and attch the router to apiv1.

//Todo 1: Implement Logging //Todo 2: Put Swagger for API documentation
